Case study to understand a dataset-Basic

## Objective:

### Task 1: Load the Data and Import Libraries
Load the dataset using pandas.

Import essential modules and helper functions from NumPy and Matplotlib.

Explore the pandas dataframe using the head() and info() functions.

Identify the type of Problem ( Regression or Classification )

### Task 2: Visualize the Data

For this dataset, we use a histogram, correlation matrix using Seaborn & Matplotlib to visualize the data

### Task 3: Splitting Data into Test and Train data

### Task 4: Train the model using Linear/Logistic algorithm 

According to which is our target variable , we use Linear or Logistic algorithm to train model

### Task5: Predicting  Accuracy Score 

### Task 6: Plot graph of predicted Values (if it is a Regression problem )
